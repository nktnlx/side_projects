Hi there!


I'm intensively learning to code and interested in data science, aiming to be hired as data analyst in 2021.  
This repository is for various side projects and code snippets I had fun with during mine coding learning journey.  


List of projects:
1. [Pull-ups Ladder Calculator](https://github.com/nktnlx/side_projects/tree/master/1_pull-ups_ladder) -- prints number of sets, amount of pull-ups to do for each set and a total number of pull-ups completed during a workout based on the maximum number of pull-ups a user wants to do and a "Ladder Technique" that has been chosen (either a one-way ladder: 1-2-3, or a two-ways ladder: 1-2-3-3-2-1).  
2. [Bad Habits Tracker](https://github.com/nktnlx/side_projects) -- not finished yet..
3. [Tinkoff Fintech tasks](https://github.com/nktnlx/side_projects/tree/master/3_tinkoff_fintech_tasks) -- my solutions to coding problems for Tinkoff Fintech Junior / Tinkoff Internship admission tests.  
4. [Career Factory](https://github.com/nktnlx/side_projects/tree/master/4_career_factory) -- my solution to an open Data Analyst competition held by [Карьерный Цех](https://careerfactory.ru/). Evaluating A/B-test design, data cleaning, data anomalies detection, checking splitting system, calculating conversion and bounce rates, log-scale transformation, Shapiro–Wilk test of normality, performing a bunch of A/B-tests using different statistical approaches (Z-test, Mann-Whitney rank test), plotting results, concluding and giving recommendations for follow-up actions.       
5. [Yandex Manager School](https://github.com/nktnlx/side_projects/tree/master/5_ya_manager_school) -- my solutions to the test tasks applying for Yandex Manager School (Product Analytics department): Python, Pandas, SQL.  



Hope this repo will help you to assess my coding skills or will be just fun for you to play with.
