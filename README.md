Hi there!


I'm intensively learning to code and interested in data science, aiming to be hired by the end of 2020.  
This repository is for various side projects and code snippets I had fun with during mine coding learning journey.  


List of projects:
1. Pull-ups Ladder Calculator -- prints number of sets, amount of pull-ups to do for each set and a total number of pull-ups completed during a workout based on the maximum number of pull-ups a user wants to do and a "Ladder Technique" that has been chosen (either a one-way ladder: 1-2-3, or a two-ways ladder: 1-2-3-3-2-1).  
2. tbc...        


Hope this repo will help you to assess my coding skills or will be just fun for you to play with.
