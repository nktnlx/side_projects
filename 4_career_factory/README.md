**Career Factory** -- my solution to an open Data Analyst competition held by [Карьерный Цех](https://careerfactory.ru/).  
The solution consists of the following steps:
* evaluating A/B-test design, 
* data cleaning, 
* data anomalies detection, 
* checking splitting system, 
* calculating conversion rate,
* calculating bounce rate,
* log-scale transformations, 
* Shapiro–Wilk test of distribution normality, 
* performing a bunch of A/B-tests using different statistical approaches: 
    - Z-test,
    - Mann-Whitney rank test
* plotting results, 
* concluding and giving recommendations for follow-up actions.    


To dig into the solution, please, refer to the code ([notebook.ipynb](https://github.com/nktnlx/side_projects/blob/master/4_career_factory/notebook.ipynb)) and the slide deck ([slides.pdf](https://github.com/nktnlx/side_projects/blob/master/4_career_factory/slides.pdf))
