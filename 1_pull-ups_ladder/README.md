Pull-ups Ladder Calculator:  
- asks a user to choose a "Ladder Technique" (either a one-way ladder: 1-2-3, or a two-ways ladder: 1-2-3-3-2-1)  
- asks the user to enter the maximum number of pull-ups per set the user wants to do
- calculates and prints number of sets  
- prints number of reps to do for each set  
- prints the total number of pull-ups completed during the workout based on the maximum number of pull-ups a user wants to do and a "Ladder Technique".
